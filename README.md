# Daily Readings App

This is a lightweight personal web app that displays the daily Catholic liturgical readings using a local JSON file. It dynamically updates to the current date and embeds Bible passages from BibleGateway (ICB translation).

## Files
- `index.html` — The main app
- `usccb_readings_2025.json` — All daily readings for 2025

## How to Use
1. Upload this repo to GitHub.
2. Deploy using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) (connect your GitHub account and this repo).
3. Done — the app will stay online with a permanent URL.

This app is built for private/personal use only. Bible passages are displayed via external embed (iframe).
